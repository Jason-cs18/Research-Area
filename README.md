# Research-Area
This repository contains research notes and implementation code. I build it for reinforcing my understanding on these papers.
The areas consists three groups: artificial intelligence (incremental learning and federated learning), operating system, network system (especially on multi-camera network)
1. Artificial Intelligence (Classic/Incremental learning/Federated learning)
2. Operating System
3. Network System (Multi-camera network systems)
